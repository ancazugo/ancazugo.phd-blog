Environmental data scientist with a passion for leveraging computational tools to address global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and urban sustainability. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in the [Sustainable Design Group (**SDG**)](https://www.sustainabledesign.arct.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, where my research focuses on assessing the impacts of urban vegetation on sustainability in cities under.

## Research

My curretn research integrates high-resolution LiDAR and aerial images of England to map trees in cities and, alongisde other geospatial datasets, assess the impact of urban vegetation in cities and its relationship to socio-economic indicators. I make heavy use of R, Python, Spark, Google Earth Engine, as well as specific tools for statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Background

I hold a Master's in Environmental Data Science from the University of Cambridge and a Master's in Biological Sciences from Universidad de los Andes (Uniandes), where I specialized in paleoecology and ancient DNA. My research has spanned diverse areas, from characterising carbon sequestration in Colombian pÃ¡ramo peatbogs to analyzing how vegetation impacts urban sustainability. I did a double major in Biology and Microbiology in Uniandes.

In addition, I worked for a real estate company in Colombian extracting data from different market places, developing machine learning models for client classification and price prediction for several cities in Colombia.

## Technical Skills

I am proficient in **R**, **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, **SQL**, and **LaTeX**, with extensive experience in:

- **Geospatial Tools**: ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth Engine
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js, Observable, R Shiny
- **Data Engineering**: Spark, Docker, AWS
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Pytorch,scikit-learn

## Teaching & Mentoring

Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring. I have designed and delivered courses on topics ranging from biostatistics and programming to machine learning and sustainability. I believe in the power of education to drive innovation and empower the next generation of scientists and technologists.

## Contact

I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn from others, so please feel free to reach out if you would like to connect or check my academic CV ([ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§](assets/documents/Andres_ZuÃ±iga_Gonzalez_CV_en.pdf), [ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸](assets/documents/Andres_ZuÃ±iga_Gonzalez_CV_es.pdf)) and professional rÃ©sumÃ© ([ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§](assets/documents/Andres_ZuÃ±iga_Gonzalez_resume_en.pdf)).
