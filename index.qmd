I am a Colombian biologist and environmental data scientist pursuing a PhD in Artificial Intelligence for Environmental Risk at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on assessing the impacts of urban vegetation on healthy cities, integrating high-resolution satellite data, machine learning, and environmental modeling to improve urban tree management and promote green equity.
