Last week was not particularly eventful but I had two very important meetings with my supervisors regarding the 3-30-300 paper. Now I feel that the paper is 95% done. The plan for most of last week and this week has been to make the suggested changes in the manuscript for a new revision.

In an attempt to compare my results with those from other non-academic organisations that measure "greenness" in cities, I tried to improve my plot from a [couple of weeks ago](2025-06-22-weekly-notes.html) using the the UK [Tree Equity Score](https://uk.treeequityscore.org/) dataset. This won't likely be included in the supplementary material because it's way more information than one can grasp, but, IMO, it's colorful and flashy, thus worth posting here ðŸ˜‚

In addition to this, I also worked on the submission of the provocation to the [PROPL25](https://propl.dev/) conference later in the year and in a couple of slides summarising my research for an AI4ER training event. These slides will be the foundation for my presentation in November for the PhD student symposium in the Department of Architecture.
