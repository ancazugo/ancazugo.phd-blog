subtitle: Analysing Swiss data on UN SDGs
title: 2021 SDG Hackathon
---

I participated in the 2021 [SDG Hackathon](https://www.sdghackathon.io/) hosted by CORELAID Switzerland and the University of Basel. The data used was obtained from text analysis of projects realted to SDGs in Switzerland using five different systems. Each system detected a number of times each SDG in each project. I wanted to show how commonly each SDG is detected by each system from the dataset and for this purpose I created a rank view of the 17 SDGs using ggbump and integrating it with ggtext and several other packages. You can check out the code in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ancazugo/sdg-hackathon).
