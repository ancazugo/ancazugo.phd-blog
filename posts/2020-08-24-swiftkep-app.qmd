subtitle: Text analysis of SwiftKey data for the Data Science Specialization in Coursera
title: SwiftKey App Visualization
---

As the final project of the Coursera Specialization in Data Science from Johns Hopkins University, I developed a shiny app that displays n_gram combination of words found in text files from blogs, newspaper and twitter. The randomly places words and generates a random shape with them. It is a fun way to explore the area of text analysis and shiny apps. If you want to know more, check the app [slides](https://rpubs.com/ancazugo/swiftkeyapp) and the [application itself](https://ancazugo.shinyapps.io/SwiftkeyShinyApp/). (The app may take a while to process your request, so give it few secs &#128513;)
