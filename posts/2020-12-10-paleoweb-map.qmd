Being a member of the Palynology and Paleoecology lab (Paleolab), led by Dr. Catalina Gonz√°lez at Universidad de los Andes, has been one of the greatest things to happen to me in my academic career. Not only have I been able to be part of many amazing projects, but I also got to meet incredible people who have helped me grow as a person and as a scientist. With Professor Catalina, we decided to update the lab website with new information, sections and publications that are available to anyone who is interested in what we have done. Part of the page is the next interactive map that illustrates the places where the Paleolab members have worked in since its foundation. You can check more information at the [Paleolab official website](https://paleouniandes.weebly.com/).
