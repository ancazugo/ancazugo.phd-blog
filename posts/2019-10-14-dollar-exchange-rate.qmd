In the last five years exchange rate between Colombia Peso and US dollar has increased dramatically, benefiting soma and affecting others. For instance, if you are a Colombian exporting coffee to the US, you'll likely benefit from a higher exchange rate, whereas if you import goods from the US in Colombia, prices will be considerably higher. This chart explores that change through time, and at the same time plays with the percpetion people have about color (red = bad, blue = good). Additionally, it also allows the user to modify the color scale to make changes more or less drastic.
